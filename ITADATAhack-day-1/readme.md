# About the problem 

The problem will ask you to create a classification of legal documents representing laws in force in the European Union (EU) with respect to the directory they belong to.

The "Directory of legal acts", i.e. the hierarchy of rules in force in the EU, includes 20 main chapters:

General, financial and institutional matters;
Customs Union and free movement of goods;
Agriculture;
Fisheries:
[â€¦]

Each chapter is divided into sub-chapters at various levels. 
The chapters have been coded with integers from 1 to 20 and represent the target of the classification, 
which must process the text of the law and/or the normative references and predict the chapter to which it belongs.
